# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler


This week's task was to create a daily calendar using HTML, CSS and jQuery. This application will also be using [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) to run its current time. When operating the calendar application, the User should be able to save their upcoming duties/activities by the hour. When the past hours has passed, User should not be able to input any text into the box nor save. User can only input and save text from the current hour or future hours. Once user saves the text, the page will automatically reload and the text will be inputted into the hour assigned.
